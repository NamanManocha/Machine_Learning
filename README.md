# Regreesion-Machine-Learning

This workbook is about predicting the housing pricing using "California housing prediction" dataset taken from Kaggle. In this workbook, we
have implemented 2 primary algorithms without the Scilit-Learn library.

Steps:
1. We start with some basic pre-visualization for undersatnding the data and analyze the trends with some predictors with dependent varibles.
2. Two algorithms are (Discussion about each algorithm is provided inside the workbook):
  -> Least Square 
  -> Least Mean Sqaure (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
3. For the evaluation purpose, RMSE for each algorithm is calculated.
4. Visualization of the results.
5. Apart from this, in this workbook further anlysis has also been done by taking some feature attributes not all and compare the results.
